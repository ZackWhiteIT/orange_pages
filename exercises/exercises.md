### **2Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ GCD Finder (Greatest Common Divisor)** (9 Points)  

Find the **GCD** of two numbers using the **Euclidean algorithm**.

**Explanation:**
The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

2. If n is even, divide it by 2.
3. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Repeat the process until n becomes 1.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Search Algorithm** (10 Points)  

Efficiently **search for a number** in a sorted list.  

**Explanation:**
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the middle element, narrow the interval to the lower half; otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeat until the value is found or the interval is empty.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Conway‚Äôs Game of Life** (10 Points)  

Simulate **Conway‚Äôs Game of Life**, a cellular automaton.

**Explanation:**
Conway‚Äôs Game of Life is a zero-player game where the evolution of a grid of cells is determined by its initial state and a set of rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

Write a program to simulate this game for a given initial grid.
